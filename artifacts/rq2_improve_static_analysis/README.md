# Research Question 2

This folder hosts the necessary files for reproducing our research question 2 (cf. Section 5.2). 

In particular, the following folders are included:

- `rq2a_benchmark`: hosts the artifacts for RQ2.a (cf. Section 5.2.1)
- `rq2b_wild`: hosts the artifacts for RQ2.b (cf. Section 5.2.2)

It is important that you review the specific instructions for reproducing the results of each of the sub-questions (RQ2.a and RQ2.b) within each of the folders before running any experiments.
