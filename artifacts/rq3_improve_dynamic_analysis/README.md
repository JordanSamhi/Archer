# Research Question 3

This folder hosts the necessary files for reproducing our research question 3 (cf. Section 5.3). 

In particular, the following folders are included:

- `rq3a_benchmark`: hosts the artifacts for RQ3.a (cf. Section 5.3.1)
- `rq3b_wild`: hosts the artifacts for RQ3.b (cf. Section 5.3.2)

It is important that you review the specific instructions for reproducing the results of each of the sub-questions (RQ3.a and RQ3.b) within each of the folders before running any experiments.
